A x 400 compound micro- scope was used for observation of the fragments. Grass fragments which were cleared sufficiently to reveal epidermal characters, contained intact silica bodies, long cells, and short cells, and were greater than 25 pm in length were considered identifiable. These fragments were classified in one of twelve categories (seven identifiable species, four identifiable genera, or ‘unkeyable grasses’) using the multiple entry key developed by S. A. Qvortrup (personal communication). Slide preparation and identification continued until 100 identifiable grass fragments were counted. Dicots, non-grass monocots, monocots that could not be classified as grasses or non-grasses, and unidentifiabIe fragments of vegetation were counted in addition to the 100 grass fragments. Leaf (including sheath) to stem ratios were calculated using only identi- fiable grass fragments.
